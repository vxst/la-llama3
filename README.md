# LA-LLAMA3

LA-LLAMA3 is a minimalist implementation of the LLAMA3 algorithm, primarily using linear algebra operations,
and its main program is confined to just 100 lines of code. This project serves as a tool to provide a clear
understanding of the fundamental workings of the LLAMA3(and generally, Transformer) architecture.

And it actually works.

This branch includes some additional code for the KV cache, and experiments with using float8 to store the KV cache.
